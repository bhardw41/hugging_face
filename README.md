To get this working you need to install pytorch and the dependecies listed in the enviornment.yml file.  You also need a copy of see-segment so you have access to the example images.  You can clone the repository using the following command:

```git clone git@github.com:see-insight/see-segment.git```

Try creating a conda enviornment using the following command:

```conda env create --prefix ./envs --file environment.yml```

Activate the enviornment by typing

```conda activate ./envs```

Then run jupyter using the following command

```jupyter lab```

or

```jupyter notebook```
